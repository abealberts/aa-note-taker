# AA's Note Taker

## Description

This is a lightweight, simple note taking app that allows users to make, store, and delete notes via a simple user interface.

AA's Note Taker was built using node.js, utilizing express as a means of communicating to the app's backend storage and functionality. The goal was to create a functioning application that gives users a useful tool, while serving as a learning opportunity for myself as I created a functional project with both a front and back end for the first time.
